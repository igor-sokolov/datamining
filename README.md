# Datamining capstone project
This repository contains all my reports and iPython notebooks that I prepared to complete [DataMining Capstone project on Coursera](https://class.coursera.org/dataminingcapstone-001). All materials are provided under MIT licence. 

The acomplishment of the whole DataMining course can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/WMPN6NNMJXJ5).

iPython files contain python subroutines used to complete each task. In addition I converted them into html files. The reports are attached in PDF format.
